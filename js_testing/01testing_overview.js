//! Goals of Testing
/*

* 1. Automate the process of ensuring that our app works as we expect.

* 2. Keep us from having to manually click around the app to find bugs (manual testing).

* 3. Make sure the app still works as expected even after we change something.

? Instructor's thoughts:
Generally, people spend more time - setting up - testing than they do writing tests.
All testing frameworks / libraries are essentially the same.
Technically, you don't even have to use a library!
