//! Axios - A Library for Making HTTP Requests
/*
The most popular of libraries that accomplish roughly the same thing.
* It simplifies the fetch process and does a lot of the work behind the scenes and is promised-based, no nasty callbacks!
* You can use it both in the client / browser side AND server side, making it versatile.
? You can access Axios by either running:
!     npm install axios 
? OR including the following script in your HTML
!     <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
! If implementing the external script, it's imperative that it comes BEFORE your own JavaScript source link.
* When we used fetch, we had to manually check the status code, with Axios, it knows that if it's a 404 or anything that's not a 200, it knows not to run and to reject it.
